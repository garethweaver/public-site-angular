  description: <p>When running a Kickstarter it's never a bad idea to throw up a microsite to promote your campaign or project. I designed this microsite to be big and bold while encouraging people to get involed and fund the project. Headless Ghost mimics a high resolution display unit for headless machines for GPU accelerated remote desktop and crypto currency mining.</p>
